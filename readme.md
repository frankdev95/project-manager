# Project

This project is the first draft of a project manager which could be used for a small structural engineering firm. The program allows you to input and organise important details about projects your firm is currently or has previously worked on. In the programs current state, the only screens available is an input form allowing a new project to be entered, and an edit form allowing only a few fields about existing projects to be modified. The program uses the JavaFX software platform which controls the user interface, allowing easy transferral and communication of data from the user to an SQLite database. The database utilises a range of tables to capture the many details associated with a project, each with a unique id to easily join the details together. The end goal of the project is as follows: 
  * To capture information about new projects.
  * Allow the user to update any of the data associated with a project. 
  * Allow an invoice to be printed for the client of the project.
  * Allow a project to be finalised and a completion date added to the details. 
  * See all the projects in a user friendly manner with a smooth user interface experience. 
  * See al the projects that are past the due date.
  * Allow a search facility to find a project by entering its project number or name.

# How to use the code

As the project uses the JavaFX software platform and SQLite database, both these have to be downloaded for the project in order for it to run, you can download them here: [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [SQLite](sqlite.org/download.html). Additionally , depending on the IDE you are using, the setup for both JavaFX and SQLite will be different. A google search can tell you how to download and use it with the IDE you are currently wishing to use.
